   <h4>May 20, 2020</h3>
    <p> You’ve probably heard more about the perils of blue light lately because our
        lives are more likely to be lived indoors and online. Our laptops, phones,
        tablets, TVs and even LED light bulbs are all sources of blue light. And now
        that we’re tethered to those devices, are we getting drenched? Should we be
        more worried about damage to our skin? </p>

    <p>  Here’s what we know: Compared with the well-understood dangers of
        ultraviolet light (skin aging and cancer), science isn’t settled on the effects
        of indoor sources of blue light on skin. It can cause hyperpigmentation and
        premature aging, but the rest — what dose of it causes trouble, for instance
        — was debated well before we were confined to our homes.</p>

    <p> Here, we’ve checked in with some blue light and skin experts to help us
        understand the real risks.</p>
    <h2>What is blue light?</h2>
    <p>When we think about the harmful effects of light, we’re usually thinking 
     ultraviolet light (UV), which is invisible. But we can see blue light. You may
     perceive it as a cool-toned white light (as with an LED light bulb), or you
     may not be aware of much blue at all. That’s because your indoor light
     sources are emitting varying wavelengths that combine to create the colors you perceive.
    </p>

    <p>Though the effects of blue light on the skin are yet to be fully understood,
        the light is an important health concern because of other risks. “Blue light
        damages the retina and reduces your excretion of melatonin, so it
        interrupts your sleep cycle,” said Michelle Henry, a dermatologist in New 
        York.
    </p>
        
    <p>Proximity is, of course, a factor when thinking about the danger. “You’ll get
        less blue light from your TV than from your computer because it’s farther
        away,” Dr. Henry said. “And more light from your phone than your
        computer because your phone is so close to your face.”
    </p>
<h2>How does blue light damage my skin?</h2>
<p>While ultraviolet light damages cells’ DNA directly, blue lightWhile ultraviolet light damages cells’ DNA directly, blue light
collagen through oxidative stress. A chemical in skin called flavin absorbs
blue light. The reaction that takes place during that absorption produces
unstable oxygen molecules (free radicals) that damage the skin.
</p>
<p>“They go in and basically poke holes in your collagen,” Dr. Henry said.</p>
<p>Exposure to blue light is more problematic for skin of color. In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15349307">a 2010 study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology,</a> it 
was shown to cause hyperpigmentation in medium to dark skin,
while leaving lighter skin relatively unaffected.
</p>
    
<p>The medical community categorizes skin color based on how it
    reacts to UV light. Type 1 is the lightest color with the most UV
    sensitivity. “This would be Nicole Kidman and Conan O’Brien,”
    said Mathew M. Avram, the director of the Massachusetts General
    Hospital Dermatology Laser and Cosmetic Center in Boston. The
    scale goes up to Type 6, which is the darkest and least likely to
    burn.
</p>
<p>
    In the 2010 study, Type 2 skin was exposed to blue light but didn’
    develop pigmentation. Skin of color darkened, and that darkness
    persisted for a couple of weeks.
</p>
<p>
    “There is something about the pigmentation in Types 4, 5 and 6
    that reacts differently than in patients with fair skin,” Dr. Avram
    aid. “There should be more large-scale studies looking at this
    because pigmentation is one of the biggest patient concerns and
    the one where treatment creates less patient satisfaction.”
</p>
<h2>But isn’t blue light used to treat acne?</h2>
<p>
    Yes, blue light lamps treat acne and precancerous lesions. “It
    damages the skin, but on the other hand it can treat acne,” Dr.
    Avram said. “It can help your mood and memory as well. So it’s
    more complicated than just saying ‘good’ or ‘bad.’”
</p>
<h2>How can I prevent skin damage?</h2>
<p>The simplest intervention is to limit the amount of blue light
     emitted from your devices. Apple products have “night shift” that
      creates a warmer screen tone. Swap out your standard LED bulbs
       for versions that emit less blue light.
</p>
<p>Mineral sunscreens with iron oxides are the gold standard in blue
     light protection. Iron oxides have been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6718061/">shown to be more
        protective</a> against visible light than zinc oxide and titanium
         dioxide alone.
</p>
<p>“A good cheat for this is any tinted sunscreen, which usually has
    iron oxide,” Dr. Henry said. <a href="https://skinbetter.com/products/sunbetter-tone-smart-spf-68-sunscreen-compact/">Skinbetter Science Sunbetter Tone
        Smart SPF 68 Sunscreen Compact</a>, $55, is one such mineral
        sunblock.The formula combines zinc oxide, titanium dioxide and
       iron oxide, and it blends smoothly, even on brown skin.</p>

<p>Topical antioxidants should help tame the free radicals blue light
     creates, but again, the science isn’t fully formed.</p>

<p>“I cannot recommend antioxidants from a purely scientific perspective,” 
     said Alexander Wolf, a senior assistant professor at Nippon Medical School
     in Tokyo and an expert in how light and oxidative stress cause premature
     aging. “But there are certainly a lot of experiments that show antioxidants
     work well in cultured cells. Vitamin C enters the cells directly,and if you do
     some oxidative damage to the cells, the vitamin C or some antioxidant
      definitely helps.”</p>

<p>“But a dish with some cells is not skin,” Dr. Wolf added.</p>

<p>As long as you’re clear that antioxidants haven’t been proven to work on
     blue light, but would likely work, they are a good substitute for sunscreen if 
     you feel weird about sitting at home with a face full of minerals.It’s likely 
     that antioxidants will also minimize the damage of a blue LED light device
     used at home to treat acne. (A mineral sunscreen would block the blue light
     and stop its bacteria-killing action.)</p>

<p>As far as antioxidants go, vitamin C is a good choice because the molecule
    is actually small enough to penetrate the skin. <a href="https://gethyperskin.com/products/hyper-clear">Hyper Skin Hyper Clear
    Brightening Clearing Vitamin C Serum</a> , $36, contains 15 percent vitamin C
    paired with vitamin E, and the two ingredients boost each other’s potential
    to fight free radicals.   </p>

<p>The buzz around blue light has led to new lines like Goodhabit. Its <a href="https://goodhabitskin.com/products/glow-potion-oil-serum">Rescue
    Me Glow Potion Oil Serum</a> , $80, combines marine-sourced proteins with
    exopolysaccharides — that is, polymers secreted by microorganisms that
    create a protective barrier over the skin. The polymers act like a sunscreen
    that blocks blue light(rather than neutralizing free radicals like an antioxidant).</p>

<p>Though alpha-lipoic acid is not touted for its blue light protective qualities,
     Dr. Wolf has studied its effect on oxidative stress (in mouse skin) and thinks
      it is promising for human skin.</p>

<p>“It works differently than an antioxidant,” he said. “It activates the natural 
    defenses of the skin cell by tricking the skin cell to think, ‘Oh, there is 
    oxidative stress.’ The cell turns up its own defense mechanisms. I think 
    that’s a much more elegant way to defend yourself.”</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.perriconemd.com/products/face-finishing-firming-moisturizer-51090023">Perricone MD High Potency Classics: Face Finishing & Firming
    Moisturizer</a> , $69, contains both vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid.</p>

<p>One important fact is often left out of the blue light conversation: The sun is
   by far our most abundant source of blue light.</p>

<p>“Brightness is not something the human eye is good at gauging because the
    pupil adjusts,” Dr. Wolf said. “You may think your tablet or smartphone is
    bright, but as far as the amount of light reaching your skin, it is very weak,
    especially compared to the sun.”</p>

<p>All things considered, then, your blue light exposure may well be down
    when compared to your pre-pandemic life for the simple reason that you’re
    spending more time indoors.</p>
